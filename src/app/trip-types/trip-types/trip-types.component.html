                <h3>Too hard to choose between all these inspiring ideas?</h3>
                <p>
                    No problem, the local agents selected by Evaneos know how to create a customized trip based on your needs. Every one of these ideas can be completely personalized and changed to fit you. Evaneos gives you the freedom to travel like never before</p>

                    <h6>And what about a Safari?</h6>

                    <p>As a kid your room was filled with stuffed girafes, elephants, and tigers. You saw The Lion King at least 10 times. You watch all the animal documentaries you can find and you already know what the Big Five* is. If that's the case, our "Untamed World" tours were made for you. Evaneos.com has carefully chosen exceptional trips to Africa, from Tanzania to Kenya, Namibia to Botswana, and from South Africa all the way north to Burkina Faso. Why not Benin or Cameroun too?</p>

                    <p>If it's less classic safari style adventures that you seek, why not try with a different continent? You can find the same incredible "Untamed World" experiences in Ecuador, Costa Rica, Canada, New Zealand, or even Nepal...</p>

                    <h6>Thanks, but I would prefer to make my own way without a guide or a drive... I can do it on my own!</h6>

                    <p>Do just to words 'organized traveling', 'guided tours', or 'group outings' give you a headache? You prefer to rent a car or camping van and make your own way, discovering new countrysides as you go along? Following the group is out of the question-for you, total independence guarantees a successful trip.<br/>

                    We have selected the best trips to take in complete freedom, without any guides in the destination. On every continent, from Denmark to Indonesia, Brazil to the Usa. Whether you want off the beaten track or total luxury, traveling without a guide has never been more simple.<br/>

                    And of course, like always with Evaneos.com all of our travel ideas can be further personalized to create the perfect trip just for you!<br/>

                    *Big Five game animals usually refers to lions, elephants, buffaloes, leopards, and rhinos.</p>
